# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
For this algorithim we took in an array of integers and reversed their order. 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge was to reverse the order of the integers that were in the array

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
For this task we chose to use a while loop that had a int i set to 0 or the beginning, and int j set to the end which we used the length of the array for. We then used a temperary int to store the value of the array at position i then assigning position i to the number at the array at position j. Position j is then given the value of the temp which is the array at position i. Then position i is advanced one place and j is decresed one place until the whole array is sorted. 


while loop efficiency is 0 (n^2)
